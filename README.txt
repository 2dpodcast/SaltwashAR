SaltwashAR is a Python Augmented Reality application.

Documentation can be found on my Wiki: https://github.com/rdmilligan/SaltwashAR/wiki

To see what it can do, check out my 'SaltwashAR' video: https://youtu.be/saDeD26KRYo

To help develop the application, check out my 'Adding a feature to SaltwashAR' post: https://rdmilligan.wordpress.com/2016/01/09/adding-a-feature-to-saltwashar/

SaltwashAR uses OpenCV computer vision to detect a 2D marker in a webcam, and OpenGL graphics library to render a 3D robot upon the marker.

We can interact with the robots:
- ask a robot to search the web, translate phrases, provide a world weather report or help us practice acting
- let the robot learn a card game, give a slideshow, be a talking calculator or a mixing desk
- a robot can watch TV, respond to our hand gestures, read printed words or just be happy!
