SaltwashAR is a Python Augmented Reality application.

To see what it can do, check out my 'SaltwashAR' video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfP_C4ZTtuo

To help develop the application, check out my 'Augmented Reality with hand gestures' post: https://rdmilligan.wordpress.com/2015/12/13/augmented-reality-with-hand-gestures/

SaltwashAR uses:
- OpenCV computer vision to detect a 2D marker in a webcam
- OpenGL graphics library to render a robot upon the marker
- Speech To Text and Text To Speech technologies to ask the robot to search the web and read out the results
- OpenCV Haar Feature-based Cascade Classifiers to let the robot respond to hand gestures
