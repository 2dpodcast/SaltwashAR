SaltwashAR is a Python Augmented Reality application.

Documentation can be found on my Wiki: https://github.com/rdmilligan/SaltwashAR/wiki

To see what it can do, check out my 'SaltwashAR' video: https://youtu.be/saDeD26KRYo

To help develop the application, check out my 'Adding a feature to SaltwashAR' post: https://rdmilligan.wordpress.com/2016/01/09/adding-a-feature-to-saltwashar/

SaltwashAR uses:
- OpenCV computer vision to detect a 2D marker in a webcam
- OpenGL graphics library to render a robot upon the marker
- Speech To Text and Text To Speech to ask the robot to search the web and read out the results
- OpenCV Haar Feature-based Cascade Classifiers to let the robot respond to hand gestures
- PyBrain Reinforcement Learning to let the robot master a card game
- OpenCV colour detection to help the robot be happy
- PyTesser Optical Character Recognition to let the robot read out printed words
- OpenCV object detection to let the robot watch television
- Speech To Text and Pygame to let the robot translate phrases
- Speech To Text and Text To Speech to let the robot be a talking calculator
