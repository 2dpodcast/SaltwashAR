SaltwashAR is a Python Augmented Reality application.

To see what it can do, check out my post: https://rdmilligan.wordpress.com/2015/11/13/blender-animation-in-opengl/

SaltwashAR uses:
- OpenCV computer vision to detect a 2D marker in a webcam
- OpenGL graphics library to render a robot upon the marker
- Speech To Text and Text To Speech technologies to ask the robot to search the web and listen to the results
